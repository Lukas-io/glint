tool: network_wait_for_app
description: Block until a Flutter app registers with a running DTD, then attach to it and return the attach result. Polls about once a second until the app attaches or the timeout passes.
when_to_use: When the app is still launching (or relaunching) and network_status does not list it yet.
---

## DO NOT USE THIS TOOL WHEN

- The app is already listed in `network_status.knownApps`. Call `network_attach` directly; it answers without waiting.
- Several apps are running and you have not picked one. Without `appNameContains` this returns straight away with the list instead of waiting.
- The session cap (`FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_MAX_ATTACH`) is reached. Waiting cannot free a slot; this returns straight away. Detach a session first.
- The app is a release / profile build. It never registers a VM service, so this only ends at the timeout.
- You only want history. Use `session_list` + `session_open`.

## Use this when

- The user just started `flutter run` and the app is still building or booting.
- The app exited and you expect it back (for example, `network_status` says it "has exited" and suggests this tool).
- You would otherwise poll `network_status` in a loop.

## How it works

1. Clamps `timeoutMs` to 1000 to 300000 (default 30000). The tool is exempt from the per-tool deadline (`FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_TOOL_TIMEOUT_MS`), so the wait is not cut short.
2. On each poll (about once a second) it drops the DTD probe cache, so a newly registered app is seen straight away.
3. Without `appNameContains`: lists the apps of EVERY running DTD, not only the startup default one.
   - No app yet: waits and polls again.
   - Exactly one app: attaches to it by its VM service URI.
   - Several apps: returns at once with `errorKind: bad_argument`, the `apps` list, and one `network_wait_for_app appNameContains:"..."` step per app.
4. With `appNameContains`: runs the same attach as `network_attach appNameContains:"..."`, matched across every running DTD. No matching app yet: waits and polls again.
5. The attach succeeds, or the app is already attached (`alreadyAttached:true`, with that session's id): returns the attach result plus `waitedMs` and `polls`. Like `network_attach`, it closes an open `session_open` view so the next bare read targets the live session, and adds a warning naming the closed view (`session_open id:<n>` reopens it).
6. Answers that waiting cannot change (several apps match, session cap reached; the attach marks them `retryable:false`) return at once as `errorKind: bad_argument`, with the attach result's `apps` or `attached` list and `nextSteps`.
7. Any other failed attempt (no app yet, attach in progress, a failed connect) is retried until the deadline. Then the call returns `errorKind: timeout` with the last attempt's error as `lastAttempt`.

When the call carries a progress token (`_meta.progressToken`), the tool sends `notifications/progress` about every 15 s while it waits: `progress` is the ms waited, `total` the clamped `timeoutMs`, and `message` the current phase (waiting for an app to register, or probing DTD and attaching) with seconds waited, poll count, and the last attempt's error. Notifications stop when the call returns. Without a token it sends none, and a long `timeoutMs` blocks silently for that long.

## Args

- `timeoutMs` (int, optional, default 30000): how long to wait, in ms. Clamped to 1000 to 300000.
- `appNameContains` (string, optional): attach only an app whose name contains this (case-insensitive). Pass it when several apps may register at once.

The attach uses the server's default DTD settings; there is no `dtdUri`, `vmServiceUri`, `logBufferSize`, `reattach` or `nativeLogs` arg here. Use `network_attach` when you need those.

## Returns

Success: the full `network_attach` reply (see [`network_attach`](network_attach.md)) plus two fields:
```json
{
  "attached": true,
  "summary": "Attached to eats_mobile, capturing HTTP+sockets+logs into session 14.",
  "scope": {"sessionId": 14, "appName": "eats_mobile", "isLive": true},
  "liveSessionId": 14,
  "waitedMs": 7420,
  "polls": 8,
  "nextSteps": ["Drive the app to generate traffic", "Then call network_list / logs_tail"]
}
```

Already attached (success):
```json
{
  "attached": true,
  "alreadyAttached": true,
  "summary": "Already attached to eats_mobile in session 14; reusing it, nothing new was started.",
  "liveSessionId": 14,
  "waitedMs": 30,
  "polls": 1
}
```

Error (several apps, no `appNameContains`):
```json
{
  "error": "2 apps are running; pass appNameContains to pick one.",
  "errorKind": "bad_argument",
  "apps": [{"name": "Kind: Flutter - Device: iPhone 17 - Package: app_a", "uri": "ws://..."},
           {"name": "Kind: Flutter - Device: Pixel 8 - Package: app_b", "uri": "ws://..."}],
  "nextSteps": ["network_wait_for_app appNameContains:\"Kind: Flutter - Device: iPhone 17 - Package: app_a\"",
                "network_wait_for_app appNameContains:\"Kind: Flutter - Device: Pixel 8 - Package: app_b\""],
  "waitedMs": 12,
  "polls": 1
}
```

With `appNameContains` matching several apps, the error is the attach's "Multiple apps across DTDs match ..." message, also as `bad_argument`. With the session cap reached, it is the attach's "Reached max attached sessions ..." message with `attached` and `maxAttach`.

Error (timeout):
```json
{
  "error": "No app attached within 30000ms (polled 30 time(s)). Waited for a name containing \"eats\".",
  "errorKind": "timeout",
  "waitedMs": 30012,
  "polls": 30,
  "lastAttempt": "No app name contains \"eats\" on any running DTD. Visible apps: ...",
  "nextSteps": ["launch the app, or check it is not crashing on start",
                "network_status ..."]
}
```

Without `appNameContains`, the timeout `nextSteps` also suggest passing it when several apps may run.

## Pairs well with

- `network_status`: its `nextSteps` suggest this tool when a previously attached app has exited.
- `network_attach`: the non-blocking version, with the full set of args.
- `network_list` / `logs_tail`: read the new session once attached.

## Example

App still building:
```
> network_wait_for_app appNameContains:"eats_mobile" timeoutMs:120000
< {attached:true, liveSessionId:14, waitedMs:41200, polls:42}
```

Two apps up, no name given:
```
> network_wait_for_app
< {errorKind:"bad_argument", error:"2 apps are running; pass appNameContains to pick one.", apps:[...]}
> network_wait_for_app appNameContains:"app_a"
< {attached:true, appName:"...app_a", liveSessionId:15}
```
