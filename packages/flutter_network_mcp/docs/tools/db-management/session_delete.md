tool: session_delete
description: Permanently delete a session and ALL its captured data. Dry-run by default; requires confirm:true.
when_to_use: When freeing disk space by removing sessions no longer worth keeping.
---

## DO NOT USE THIS TOOL WHEN

- The session is still capturing: call `network_detach` first. Delete refuses (`errorKind: "session_in_use"`) any session attached in this server, however many are attached, and any session another live server process sharing the DB still captures into (`session_list` shows it as `status: "live"` with `capturedElsewhere: true`).
- You want to keep metadata but drop bodies — use `bodies_purge` instead.
- You're not sure — call without `confirm:true` first for a dry-run that shows what would be deleted (counts included).
- The user might want it later — consider `session_export id:<n> format:"har"` as a backup first.

## Use this when

- User explicitly asks to remove a session.
- DB size up and `db_stats` shows old sessions with large body sizes.
- Cleaning up after test runs or failed captures.

## How it works

Two-phase by default. First call (no `confirm:true`): dry-run with full counts so the agent can echo "would delete X http, Y logs, Z sockets". Second call (`confirm:true`): actual `DELETE FROM sessions WHERE id = ?`, which cascades via foreign keys to http_requests, http_bodies, socket_events, log_records, alerts, and session_attachments. FTS5 search rows are dropped first by hand since FTS doesn't honor FK cascades. Decrypted body text this process held in memory for search (body decryption on) is dropped too. If the deleted session was the one opened with `session_open`, the read pointer reverts to live. **Disk space is NOT reclaimed**: run `db_vacuum` afterwards.

## Args

- `id` (int, required): session id from `session_list`.
- `confirm` (bool, default false): required true to delete.

## Returns

Dry-run:
```json
{
  "summary": "DRY-RUN — would delete session 7 (eats_mobile) and 38 http, 12 log(s), 3 socket(s). Cannot be undone.",
  "dryRun": true,
  "sessionId": 7,
  "appName": "eats_mobile",
  "startedMs": ..., "endedMs": ..., "note": "old debug",
  "counts": {"http":38, "sockets":3, "logs":12},
  "nextSteps": [
    "session_export id:7 format:\"har\" outPath:\"...\" — back up before deleting",
    "session_delete id:7 confirm:true — proceed with the delete"
  ]
}
```

Confirmed:
```json
{
  "summary": "Deleted session 7 (eats_mobile) — 38 http, 12 log(s), 3 socket(s) removed.",
  "deleted": true,
  "sessionId": 7,
  "appName": "eats_mobile",
  "counts": {"http":38, "sockets":3, "logs":12},
  "warnings": ["Disk space is NOT reclaimed yet — run db_vacuum to compact the file."],
  "nextSteps": [
    "db_vacuum — reclaim disk space after the delete",
    "session_list — confirm the session no longer appears"
  ]
}
```

`appName`, `endedMs`, and `note` are omitted when null. The confirmed reply's counts are measured just before the delete.

Errors (a session still capturing is checked before the dry-run too):
- missing `id`: `bad_argument`.
- a session attached in this server: `session_in_use` with `capturedBy: "this server"` and nextSteps to `network_detach sessionId:<n>` first.
- a session another live server process captures into: `session_in_use` with `capturedBy: "another server process"`, `otherProcesses` (how many), and nextSteps to detach it there or close that server, or `bodies_purge` instead.
- an unknown id: `not_found`.

## Pairs well with

- `session_list` — find ids before deleting.
- `session_export` — back up first.
- `db_vacuum` — reclaim disk space after.
- `bodies_purge` — middle-ground (keep metadata, drop bodies).

## Example

```
> session_list limit:50
> session_delete id:7
< {dryRun:true, summary:"DRY-RUN — would delete..."}
> session_delete id:7 confirm:true
< {deleted:true, summary:"Deleted session 7..."}
> db_vacuum
```
