tool: network_search
description: Full-text search across captured HTTP urls + request/response bodies (SQLite FTS5), with BM25 ranking.
when_to_use: When the user describes a symptom in plain language ("auth failed", "rate_limit") and you need to find the requests that contain that string.
---

## DO NOT USE THIS TOOL WHEN

- The request just completed and you need a BODY match. URLs are searchable from first sight, but bodies only after the capture writer backfills them (~2s tick). Retry shortly.
- You only need to filter by host/method/status. `network_list` does that without a full-text scan.
- You already have a specific id. Use `network_get`.
- The match is structural (header present, status range, time window). Use `network_query` with SQL; headers are not in the search index.
- You want operator semantics (AND, OR, NEAR, prefix `*`). The query is always wrapped as one FTS5 phrase, so operators are matched as literal words. Compose several calls, or write a `MATCH` query over `http_search` with `network_query` (that reads the capture DB only, so it never sees decrypted plaintext).
- You want a regex. There is no regex mode here; `network_body_query grep:` runs a regex inside one body.
- The term spans several captured sessions (for example an originator app and a receiver app). Use `network_correlate`.

## Use this when

- "Find the request whose response had 'invalid_token'". Exactly this.
- Searching history for a token you remember by content.
- The user pasted an error message: "where did this come from?"
- You remember part of a URL path or a percent-encoded query value (the index holds each URL raw and percent-decoded).

## How it works

Resolves the session like the other read tools (`sessionId`, else `appNameContains`, else the `session_open` view, else the sole or default attached session). Wraps the query as an FTS5 phrase (`"..."`, inner quotes doubled) so `-`, `:`, `(` and similar don't trip the parser. `which` limits the phrase to one column: `url`, `content_request` or `content_response`; `any` matches all three. Ranked by BM25 (lowest `rank` = best match). Snippets are 12-token windows with «highlights».

**Without body decryption** (the default), it searches the capture DB's FTS5 table `http_search` (url + content_request + content_response), joined back to `http_requests` via `http_search_map`. The capture writer indexes each URL (raw and percent-decoded) when it first sees the request, then re-indexes with body text when it backfills the bodies (~2s tick). A body is indexed only when its own content type contains json, xml, text, javascript, graphql or form-urlencoded; it is decoded as UTF-8. Other bodies (binary, images, protobuf) are never indexed.

**With body decryption on** (`session_configure bodyDecryption:{...}`), it searches an in-memory FTS5 index instead. On the first search of a session it reads every stored request of that session from the capture DB, decrypts each stored body with the configured AES-CTR scheme, and indexes the plaintext with the URL. A body that does not decrypt to UTF-8 text is indexed as-is when the request's stored content type (the response's, else the request's) is textual, else not at all. Later searches (and `network_correlate`) add requests that arrived since and re-read requests whose bodies were not final yet. The plaintext index lives only in this process's memory: nothing decrypted is written to the capture DB. It is dropped when `session_configure` sets a new scheme (even the same key again), turns decryption off (`bodyDecryption:{off:true}`), or runs `clear:true`, and it dies with the process. Replies look the same in both modes (no field says a match came from plaintext), but snippets can show decrypted text. The first search after turning decryption on decrypts every stored body of the session, so it takes longer on a large session.

On zero matches the reply reports index coverage from the capture DB: nothing indexed yet, only some of the captured requests indexed, some bodies never stored, or everything indexed (the term is absent). It then adds `availableHosts` (up to 15 hosts, busiest first), `suggestedPaths` (up to 5 captured paths close to the query) and a warning that only dart:io traffic is captured.

## Args

- `query` (string, required). Phrase-matched; must not be blank. FTS5 matches whole tokens (case-insensitive), so a fragment of a word does not match: `tok` does not find `token`. Punctuation such as `_`, `-`, `/` splits words.
- `sessionId` (int, optional). Defaults to the auto-resolved session.
- `appNameContains` (string, optional). Pick the attached session by app-name substring instead of `sessionId`.
- `isolateId` (string, optional). Restrict to one isolate (id from `network_status`).
- `which` (string, default `"any"`). `"url"` | `"request"` | `"response"` | `"any"`.
- `limit` (int, default 20, cap 100). Values <= 0 fall back to 20.

## Returns

```json
{
  "scope": {"sessionId": 14, "appName": "my_app", "isLive": true},
  "sessionId": 14,
  "summary": "1 match(es) for \"invalid_token\" in session 14 (ranked by BM25).",
  "query": "invalid_token",
  "which": "any",
  "count": 1,
  "matches": [
    {"sessionId":14, "id":"req-1", "method":"POST",
     "url":"https://api.example.com/v1/login", "statusCode":500,
     "snippet":"{\"error\":\"«invalid_token»\",\"message\":\"auth failed\"}",
     "rank": -1.2e-06}
  ],
  "nextSteps": [
    "network_get id:\"req-1\" ..."
  ]
}
```

With two or more matches, `nextSteps` also offers `network_diff idA:<top> idB:<second>`.

Empty results use the summary `No matches for "<query>" in session N (which=<which>).` and carry `warnings` (index coverage plus the capture-boundary note), `availableHosts` and `suggestedPaths` when there is something to suggest, and `nextSteps` such as `did you mean: "/driver/deliveries" ...`, `Retry with a shorter substring or which:"any"`, and `network_list`.

Errors:

| Cause | `errorKind` |
|---|---|
| `query` missing or blank | `bad_argument` |
| `which` not url / request / response / any | `bad_argument` |
| The search itself threw (`network_search failed: ...`) | `bad_query` |
| No session could be resolved, or `appNameContains` matched none / several | none (error with `nextSteps`) |

## Pairs well with

- `network_get`: pass the matched id for full detail.
- `session_open`: search inside a specific historical session.
- `network_diff`: once you have two matching ids.
- `network_list`: when metadata filtering is more direct.
- `network_correlate`: the same search across several sessions, paired by time.
- `session_configure`: turn on body decryption for app-encrypted bodies.

## Example

```
> network_search query:"invalid_token"
< {summary:"1 match(es)...", matches:[{id:"req-1", snippet:"{...«invalid_token»..."}]}
> network_get id:"req-1"
```
