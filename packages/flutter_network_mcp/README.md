# flutter_network_mcp

You're debugging a flaky API call in your Flutter app. You alt-tab to DevTools, find the request, copy the response, paste it into the chat with Claude. Twenty seconds. Then it happens again ten minutes later. And again. By the end of the session you've spent more time being the agent's hands than thinking about the bug.

This MCP server skips the alt-tab. It plugs into any running Flutter or Dart app via the Tooling Daemon, exposes the DevTools "Network" tab — plus dart:io sockets and app logs — as tools your agent calls directly, persists everything to a local SQLite database so it survives across sessions, and **proactively surfaces issues** (HTTP errors, slow requests, Flutter exceptions) without you having to ask. There's also full-text search across every body you've ever captured.

## What this is for

- Debugging API issues with Claude without copy-pasting requests around.
- Asking the agent to compare today's app behavior against a previous session — "did the auth header change since Tuesday?"
- Generating a HAR file from a capture session you can hand a coworker without screen-sharing.
- Finding the one request that contained a specific error message across weeks of history.
- Letting the agent open an investigation with `alerts_drain` — it tells you what's broken without being asked.

Not for: production observability, traffic outside `dart:io` HTTP, or release/profile builds where the VM service is stripped.

## Install

```bash
dart pub global activate -s git https://github.com/Lukas-io/flutter_network_mcp.git
```

The binary lands at `~/.pub-cache/bin/flutter_network_mcp` (Flutter installs put that directory on `$PATH`). `package:sqlite3` ships its own native lib so there's no system dependency to chase.

Then in any project's `.mcp.json` (or `~/.claude.json` for machine-wide):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flutter-network": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "flutter_network_mcp",
      "args": ["--dtd-uri", "ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/<token>="]
    }
  }
}
```

`--dtd-uri` is optional — pass it once and `network_attach` works with no args. The DTD WS URI is printed in the IDE console when you `flutter run`.

## Found a bug? Let your agent file it

**Issue filing for this MCP is agent-first.** Two templates in the repo, both designed for an agent to fill and submit in one shot — neither is required to be long:

- **[Bug report](https://github.com/Lukas-io/flutter_network_mcp/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)** — 3 required fields (what broke, the failing tool call, `network_status` response). Optional detail (environment, repro steps, stderr) lives under a collapsible block — agents fill what they can see and submit, you don't have to type anything.
- **[UX friction / suggestion](https://github.com/Lukas-io/flutter_network_mcp/issues/new?template=ux_friction.md)** — even simpler. For anything that *works* but feels awkward, confusing, slow, or unclear. 3 fields, no environment needed.

If you're using Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-capable agent, just say *"file a bug for this"* or *"file a UX friction report"* and the agent should open the template, fill it, and submit (using a GitHub tool if available, otherwise handing you a paste-ready body). The MCP server's `instructions` field directs agents to do this proactively, no permission needed.

This is a young package with a small user base — every report compounds. Don't filter for "important enough" before filing; that's the maintainer's job.

## Environment knobs (fine-tune at startup)

Beyond capability gating, these env vars tune runtime behavior:

| Env var | Default | Clamped to | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_POLL_MS` | 2000 | 50–60000 | CaptureWriter poll interval. Lower for chatty apps, higher for quiet ones. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_LOG_BUFFER` | 500 | 50–10000 | In-memory log ring buffer size for `logs_tail` live mode. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DTD_URI` | — | — | Default DTD URI for `network_attach`. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DATA_DIR` | — | — | Directory for `captures.db`. Equivalent to `--data-dir`. When set, the candidate-fallback chain is skipped — unwritable values error loudly. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_MAX_ATTACH` | 4 | 1–32 | Max concurrent attached sessions in multi-attach mode. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH` | — | `true`/`1` | Watch DTD for new apps and auto-attach. Equivalent to `--auto-attach`. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH_POLL_MS` | 5000 | 1000–60000 | Poll interval for the auto-attach watcher. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_CAPABILITIES` | (all) | — | Allowlist (see below). |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DISABLE` | — | — | Denylist (see below). |

## Capability gating (control your context budget)

Thirty-three tools is a lot of schema for the agent to load. Disable the categories you don't use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flutter-network": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "flutter_network_mcp",
      "args": [
        "--dtd-uri", "ws://...",
        "--capabilities", "http,alerts,sessions,search"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The opposite is `--disable sockets,sql,admin` — start from "all on" and remove. Lifecycle (`network_status`, `network_attach`, `network_detach`) is always on.

Categories: `http` · `sockets` · `logs` · `alerts` · `search` · `sessions` · `sql` · `admin`. Env vars: `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_CAPABILITIES`, `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DISABLE`.

When a category is disabled, the disabled tools don't appear in `tools/list` AND the corresponding capture paths don't run (no log subscription if `logs` is off; no alert detection if `alerts` is off). Real context AND CPU savings.

## What it does

### Live (while attached)

- **HTTP**: requests as they happen — method, URL, headers, status, both bodies. Filterable, cursor-based, body-truncated by default.
- **Sockets**: `dart:io` TCP/UDP byte counts.
- **Logs**: `Logging` + `Stdout` + `Stderr` streams.
- **Bodies truncate at 4 KB** by default. Truncated payloads return `totalSize` + `truncated:true` so the agent knows to call `network_body` for a byte range.

### Persistent (across sessions)

Every `network_attach` opens a SQLite capture session. A 2-second writer persists HTTP requests + headers + bodies + sockets + log records. When you reattach tomorrow:

- `session_list` shows what's there
- `session_open id:<n>` points every read tool at that session
- `session_export id:<n> format:har` writes a HAR 1.2 file (Chrome DevTools / Insomnia compatible)
- `network_query "SELECT ..."` for ad-hoc SQL

### Proactive (alerts pipeline)

The server runs detection rules on every captured request and log line:

| Rule | Fires on | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `http_5xx` | HTTP status 500–599 | error |
| `http_4xx` | HTTP status 400–499 | warning |
| `http_error` | `dart:io` request/response errors | error |
| `http_slow` | duration > 3000ms (configurable) | warning |
| `log_keyword` | log matches `/error\|exception\|failed\|denied\|timeout\|refused\|crash/i` | warning (severe at level ≥1200) |
| `flutter_error` | log matches Flutter exception patterns (FlutterError, RenderFlex overflow, null check on null, setState after dispose, etc.) | critical |

The agent calls `alerts_drain` at the top of an investigation and gets the queue. `alerts_peek` reads without clearing. `alerts_config` tunes thresholds and toggles rules at runtime.

### Search (FTS5)

`network_search query="invalid_token"` returns ranked matches across URLs + utf8 request/response bodies with «highlighted» snippets. Queries are phrase-quoted by default so hyphens and special chars work naturally.

### Productivity polish

- **`network_diff idA idB`** — structural diff: status/method/url, response headers added/removed/changed, body hunks (line-based, for utf8 bodies).
- **`network_replay id`** — emits a runnable curl command. Authorization/Cookie/X-API-Key headers redacted by default; pass `redact:false` for local use.
- **`session_note id note`** — annotate sessions so future-you can find them ("auth bug 2026-05-21").
- **`ignored_hosts action:add host:...`** — drop analytics/Sentry/telemetry traffic at capture time so the DB only contains the requests that matter.

## Multi-attach (0.6.0)

You can attach to multiple running Flutter/Dart apps **simultaneously** — debug `eats_mobile` and `eats_driver` in the same agent conversation, in the same DB, without losing either side. Each attach gets its own VM connection, capture writer, and log buffer.

How it works in practice:

- `network_attach` for the first app → `sessionId:14` returned in the response's `scope` block.
- `network_attach` for the second app → `sessionId:15` (the first is untouched).
- `network_list` with no scope errors out: "ambiguous — 2 sessions attached" with `nextSteps` listing `sessionId:14  // eats_mobile`, `sessionId:15  // eats_driver`.
- `network_list sessionId:14` or `network_list appNameContains:"mobile"` returns just eats_mobile's rows.
- `network_detach all:true` drops everything cleanly when you're done.

Single-attach is unchanged — when only one session is attached, every tool auto-resolves to it and no extra args are needed. Multi-attach only adds friction when you genuinely have two apps in flight, and the friction is a structured error with a ready-to-paste fix.

Cap: `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_MAX_ATTACH` env var, default 4 (clamped 1–32). Each attach costs ~100 KB of memory (log buffer) + one 2s polling timer + 3 VM stream subscriptions.

### Multi-isolate within one app (0.6.0)

A single Flutter app can have multiple isolates (main + worker + spawned compute isolates). Previously the server captured HTTP from **only the first isolate** — worker traffic was silently invisible. **0.6.0 captures from every isolate** that exposes `ext.dart.io.getHttpProfile`, tags each captured row with its source isolate, and re-discovers newly-spawned isolates on a 10-tick (~20s) cadence so hot-reloads and runtime-spawned workers come into capture automatically.

Schema migration v3 → v4 adds nullable `isolate_id` columns. Pre-v4 rows keep `NULL` (treated as "VM-level" — still queryable, never excluded).

Every read tool that takes `sessionId:` also accepts an optional **`isolateId:`** to scope to one isolate within the session. Get the id from `network_status.attached[].isolates[].id`. Omit and the tool merges every isolate — same UX as single-isolate apps.

Per-row responses include `isolateId` when known so an agent can see which isolate produced each request, log, or socket.

### Cross-app correlate (0.6.0)

`network_correlate` is the typed companion to `network_query` SQL for the **webhook originator + receiver** pattern. When eats_mobile sends `POST /webhook/order` with body containing `txn-abc-123` and eats_driver receives `POST /handlers/order` a few hundred ms later with the same id, `network_correlate sessionIds:[14,15] pattern:"txn-abc-123" timeWindowMs:5000` returns both halves paired by time delta. See [`docs/tools/power/network_correlate.md`](docs/tools/power/network_correlate.md) for the full shape.

`sessionIds` is **required** — cross-session aggregation is intentional, so the agent must pick which apps to compare (preventing accidental cross-app data bleed). Hard caps: 8 sessions per call, 100 pair results, 500 raw matches per session.

### Auto-attach (`--auto-attach`)

Pass `--auto-attach` (or set `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH=true`) to have the server watch DTD for new apps and attach to them automatically. The watcher polls every 5 seconds (`FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH_POLL_MS` to tune, clamped 1000–60000).

Key behaviour:
- **Seed-and-skip on first tick** — apps already running when the server starts are NOT auto-attached. The watcher seeds its "known" set with whatever DTD reports first, then only attaches to URIs that appear in subsequent ticks (typically a fresh `flutter run` or a hot-restart that spawns a new DDS).
- **Manual `network_detach` is respected** — once you detach, the URI stays in the known set, so the watcher won't re-grab it. To force a re-attach, restart the app (new VM service URI) or detach + re-attach manually.
- **Cap is respected** — over-cap discoveries are logged and skipped without retrying.
- **Off by default** — no surprise grabbing of app state.

## The 33 tools

Each tool's MCP `description` (loaded into every agent at handshake) tells the agent WHEN to reach for it. This table is the same information at a glance — useful when you want to remind an agent that a tool exists, or when picking the right one yourself.

**Scope:** ✅ = accepts optional `sessionId:int` and `appNameContains:string` for multi-attach disambiguation. When only one session is attached, both args are optional (auto-resolve). With 2+ attached and no scope hint, the tool errors with a structured `nextSteps` listing the attached sessions.

| Tool | Scope | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **Lifecycle** | | |
| `network_status` | — | Always call first. Reports `attached:[]` list, DB path, active capabilities, known apps, pending alerts. Will auto-attach if exactly one app is reachable and nothing is attached yet. |
| `network_attach` | — | Connect to a running Flutter/Dart app to start capturing HTTP, sockets, and logs into a new session. **0.6.0:** can be called multiple times for different apps; per-vmServiceUri duplicate guard prevents accidental same-app re-attach. |
| `network_detach` | ✅ + `all:true` | End one capture session (sessionId / appNameContains), or `all:true` for every attached. DTD disconnects only when nothing remains attached. |
| **HTTP** | | |
| `network_list` | ✅ | Browse recent HTTP requests by metadata: host, method, status, time. Cursor-paged. |
| `network_get` | ✅ | Read full details of ONE request — headers + body + lifecycle events. Use after `network_list` or `network_search` finds the id. |
| `network_body` | ✅ | Fetch the rest of a truncated body. Call when `network_get` reports `truncated:true`. |
| `network_clear` | ✅ | Wipe the LIVE in-memory HTTP buffer for one session (DB untouched). |
| `network_diff` | ✅ | Compare two requests side-by-side to spot what changed — for regression hunting or confirming two are identical. |
| `network_replay` | ✅ | Emit a runnable curl command to reproduce a captured request in your terminal. Auth headers redacted by default. |
| **Sockets** | | |
| `socket_list` | ✅ | List `dart:io` socket connections (TCP/UDP). Mostly for correlating with HTTP. |
| `socket_get` | ✅ | Read one socket's read/write byte stats by id. |
| `socket_clear` | ✅ | Wipe the live socket buffer for one session (DB untouched). |
| **Logs** | | |
| `logs_tail` | ✅ | Read recent app logs: `print`, `developer.log`, stdout, stderr. Correlate with HTTP or chase an exception. |
| `logs_clear` | ✅ | Wipe one session's live log ring buffer (DB untouched). |
| **Alerts** | | |
| `alerts_drain` | ✅ | "What is wrong right now?" — returns pending alerts for the scoped session and marks them drained. Top of any investigation. |
| `alerts_peek` | ✅ | Same as drain but read-only (does NOT mark them drained). |
| `alerts_config` | — | Toggle alert rules / change thresholds at runtime (process-wide). |
| `alerts_clear` | ✅ | Bulk-delete alerts (drained-only by default; per-session scope). |
| `alert_patterns` | — | Add / list / remove custom regex alert rules (process-wide). |
| **Search** | | |
| `network_search` | ✅ | Find a request by text in URL or body (FTS5 ranked + highlighted). Use when you know WHAT was in the request but not the id. |
| `network_correlate` | sessionIds + pattern (both required) | Find matching requests **across 2+ sessions** by a shared substring (correlation id, webhook URL). Returns pairs sorted by smallest time delta. Caps: 8 sessions, 100 pairs, 500 matches/session. |
| **Sessions** | | |
| `session_list` | — | See past capture sessions. Pick one to reopen tomorrow. |
| `session_open` | — | Switch read tools to view a historical session (single-pointer history view). |
| `session_close` | — | Switch read tools back to the live session. |
| `session_export` | — | Write a session to a HAR 1.2 file (or NDJSON) for sharing. |
| `session_note` | — | Annotate a session ("auth bug 2026-05-21") so future-you can find it. |
| `session_delete` | — | Delete a session + every row attached to it (cascade). Requires confirm:true. |
| **SQL** | | |
| `network_query` | — | Run custom SELECT against the DB when the typed tools can't express what you need — aggregates, joins, percentile timings, cross-session queries. |
| **Admin** | | |
| `ignored_hosts` | — | Manage the capture-time host denylist (drop analytics / Sentry / telemetry). |
| `redacted_headers` | — | Manage the header denylist for `network_replay` curl emission. |
| `db_stats` | — | Report DB size, per-table row counts, body bytes. Tells you when to vacuum. |
| `db_vacuum` | — | WAL-checkpoint + VACUUM + optimize. Run after big deletes. |
| `bodies_purge` | — | Drop request/response BLOBs (keep metadata). Reclaim disk without losing history. |

**Per-tool docs live in [`docs/tools/`](docs/tools/) — every tool has its own page with a `## DO NOT USE THIS TOOL WHEN` section at the top.** Point your agent at these when you need deeper guidance than the one-liner above. The negative cases catch the bulk of misuse before it happens.

### The agent-facing contract

Every tool response — success OR error — follows the same shape, so an agent can branch on it without parsing prose:

- **`summary`** — one human-readable sentence (echo-able to the user).
- **`nextSteps`** — 1–3 concrete commands the agent can execute next; filtered against active capabilities.
- **`warnings`** — only present when something is partially degraded (truncation, in-flight, host not yet backfilled, etc.).
- **`pendingAlerts`** — `{count, critical?}` auto-injected on any success response when alerts are queued in scope. Lets the agent notice fresh alerts during normal work without polling `network_status` (the alerts pipeline is push-like in practice).
- **Errors** are `{error, contextual fields, nextSteps}` — never bare strings, never stack traces.
- Destructive ops (`session_delete`, `bodies_purge`, `alerts_clear` with `drainedOnly:false`) require explicit `confirm:true` / `force:true`; the default is a dry-run that reports impact.

## A typical session

```
You:    network_status
Agent:  capabilities:[http,alerts,sessions,search], attached:false, alerts:{pending:0}

You:    network_attach
Agent:  liveSessionId: 14

# poke around the app, server captures + alerts in the background

You:    alerts_drain
Agent:  3 alerts — 1 critical (Null check on null at home_screen:42), 2 errors (503 on /v1/login)

You:    network_search query:"invalid_token"
Agent:  req-1 — POST /v1/login — 500 — snippet "«invalid_token»"

You:    network_get id:req-1
Agent:  headers + 4 KB of body, truncated:true totalSize:18432

You:    network_body id:req-1 which:response offset:4096 length:16384
Agent:  bytes 4096-18432

You:    network_detach
You:    session_note id:14 note:"auth-bug repro for #1842"

# tomorrow
You:    session_list
Agent:  session 14 — auth-bug repro for #1842 — 38 req, 12 logs, 3 alerts

You:    session_open id:14
You:    network_query "SELECT host, AVG(duration_us)/1000 ms FROM http_requests WHERE session_id=14 GROUP BY host"
You:    session_export id:14 format:har outPath:/tmp/auth-bug.har
```

## The database

Lives at one `captures.db` file resolved via a fallback chain:

| Platform | Default path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/flutter_network_mcp/captures.db` |
| Linux / other | `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/flutter_network_mcp/captures.db` |

Override with `--data-dir` or `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DATA_DIR`. When neither is set, the server walks a candidate list (`$XDG_DATA_HOME` → platform default → `~/.cache`) and uses the first writable one, emitting a one-line stderr note if it fell back. Schema lives in [`docs/tools/network_query.md`](docs/tools/network_query.md).

> **macOS users upgrading from ≤0.5.15**: on first launch of 0.5.16, the server moves `~/.local/share/flutter_network_mcp/` to `~/Library/Application Support/flutter_network_mcp/` (atomic rename, WAL files included). Skipped if either dir's `captures.db` is missing or the new dir already has one. To opt out: set `--data-dir` or `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DATA_DIR` before launching.

WAL mode. Foreign keys with cascade delete. FTS5 virtual table for `network_search`. Indexes on `(session_id, start_us)`, `host`, `status_code`, `(session_id, timestamp_ms)`, `level`, `(drained, severity, ts_ms)`.

**Segmentation**: every captured row (`http_requests`, `http_bodies`, `socket_events`, `log_records`, `alerts`) has a `session_id` FK with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. One row in `sessions` per `network_attach` call — with `app_name`, `vm_service_uri`, `isolate_id`, `project_path`, `note`. Read tools always scope to the current live or opened session; cross-session queries go through `network_query`.

## Known issues

- **Zombie DTD** — A DTD can outlive useful service: WS upgrades succeed but RPCs hang forever. `network_attach` now fails fast within 5 seconds when this happens with a clear error. Restart the Flutter app to spawn a fresh DTD.
- **Body backfill lag** — Bodies are fetched on the writer's 2-second tick after a request completes. Live mode shows them immediately; history mode may be a beat behind. Also affects `network_search`, since FTS indexing happens during backfill.
- **Single-instance writer** — WAL mode means multiple MCP server instances against one DB *should* work, but it's untested. One MCP server per machine is the assumption.
