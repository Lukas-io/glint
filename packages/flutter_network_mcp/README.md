# flutter_network_mcp

You're debugging a flaky API call in your Flutter app. You alt-tab to DevTools, find the request, copy the response, paste it into the chat with Claude. Twenty seconds. Then it happens again ten minutes later. And again. By the end of the session you've spent more time being the agent's hands than thinking about the bug.

This MCP server skips the alt-tab. It plugs into any running Flutter or Dart app via the Tooling Daemon, exposes the DevTools "Network" tab — plus dart:io sockets and app logs — as tools your agent calls directly, persists everything to a local SQLite database so it survives across sessions, and **proactively surfaces issues** (HTTP errors, slow requests, Flutter exceptions) without you having to ask. There's also full-text search across every body you've ever captured.

## What this is for

- Debugging API issues with Claude without copy-pasting requests around.
- Asking the agent to compare today's app behavior against a previous session — "did the auth header change since Tuesday?"
- Generating a HAR file from a capture session you can hand a coworker without screen-sharing.
- Finding the one request that contained a specific error message across weeks of history.
- Letting the agent open an investigation with `alerts_drain` — it tells you what's broken without being asked.

Not for: production observability, traffic outside `dart:io` HTTP, or release/profile builds where the VM service is stripped.

## Install

```bash
dart pub global activate -s git https://github.com/Lukas-io/flutter_network_mcp.git
flutter_network_mcp install   # optional but recommended — AOT-compile for fast startup
```

The binary lands at `~/.pub-cache/bin/flutter_network_mcp` (Flutter installs put that directory on `$PATH`). `package:sqlite3` ships its own native lib so there's no system dependency to chase.

**Why the `install` step?** `dart pub global activate` ships a JIT snapshot wrapper that recompiles on every spawn (~1–2s cold). The MCP host's JSON-RPC handshake can race that recompile and mark the server "Failed to connect" on first attach, then succeed on the next probe — flickering connection status. `flutter_network_mcp install` runs `dart compile exe` once and overwrites the JIT wrapper with a native binary; startup drops to <100ms and the flicker goes away. If you skip it, the first-launch stderr emits a one-line nudge (silence with `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_NO_JIT_NUDGE=true`).

Then in any project's `.mcp.json` (or `~/.claude.json` for machine-wide):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flutter-network": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "flutter_network_mcp",
      "args": ["--dtd-uri", "ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/<token>="]
    }
  }
}
```

`--dtd-uri` is optional in 0.6.2+. When omitted, the server auto-discovers a DTD on startup by reading the standard `package:dtd` discovery directory (`~/Library/Application Support/dart/dtd` on macOS) and picking the best live candidate matching your current working directory. The discovery files include the full WS URI + security token, so no token-hunting from IDE consoles is needed. To opt out (paranoid configs, CI), pass `--no-auto-discover-dtd` or set `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_DISCOVER_DTD=false`. See the [`network_discover_dtd`](docs/tools/lifecycle/network_discover_dtd.md) tool for on-demand discovery when multiple DTDs are running. **0.6.2 also enumerates apps across every live DTD** (each `flutter run` spawns its own DTD), so `network_status.knownApps` lists apps from every running `flutter run` on the machine, not just one. Each entry carries a `dtdUri` + `workspaceRoot` naming the source DTD.

## Reconfiguring without `mcp remove + add`

When you want to change CLI args (add `--auto-attach=...`, swap `--data-dir`, etc.) the natural reflex is `claude mcp remove flutter-network && claude mcp add flutter-network ...`. There's a quieter path: **every CLI flag has an env-var fallback**. Edit your shell rc:

```bash
# ~/.zshrc or ~/.bashrc
export FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH=eats_mobile,eats_driver
export FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH_DENY="Pixel 7"
```

Restart your MCP host (Claude Code, Cursor, …) and the new config takes effect — no `claude mcp remove`, no re-registration. The [Environment knobs](#environment-knobs-fine-tune-at-startup) table below lists every variable.

## Updating

```bash
flutter_network_mcp update   # runs pub global activate + re-AOT if you installed
```

`flutter_network_mcp update` re-runs `dart pub global activate -s git https://github.com/Lukas-io/flutter_network_mcp.git` and, if you previously ran `flutter_network_mcp install`, re-runs the AOT compile so the upgrade doesn't silently downgrade you to the slow JIT wrapper. Restart your MCP host after running.

The server **runs a daily background version check** (hits `raw.githubusercontent.com/Lukas-io/flutter_network_mcp/master/pubspec.yaml`, compares versions, nudges to stderr if newer). Cached at `<data-dir>/.update-check`; opt-out via `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_NO_UPDATE_CHECK=true`.

## Found a bug? Let your agent file it

**Issue filing for this MCP is agent-first.** Two templates in the repo, both designed for an agent to fill and submit in one shot — neither is required to be long:

- **[Bug report](https://github.com/Lukas-io/flutter_network_mcp/issues/new?template=bug_report.md)** — 4 required fields (the `flutter_network_mcp` version, what broke, the failing tool call, `network_status` response). Optional detail (repro steps, stderr) lives under a collapsible block — agents fill what they can see and submit, you don't have to type anything.
- **[UX friction / suggestion](https://github.com/Lukas-io/flutter_network_mcp/issues/new?template=ux_friction.md)** — even simpler. For anything that *works* but feels awkward, confusing, slow, or unclear. 4 short fields (version + 3), no environment needed.

If you're using Claude Code, Cursor, or any MCP-capable agent, just say *"file a bug for this"* or *"file a UX friction report"* and the agent should open the template, fill it, and submit (using a GitHub tool if available, otherwise handing you a paste-ready body). The MCP server's `instructions` field directs agents to do this proactively, no permission needed.

This is a young package with a small user base — every report compounds. Don't filter for "important enough" before filing; that's the maintainer's job.

## Environment knobs (fine-tune at startup)

Beyond capability gating, these env vars tune runtime behavior:

| Env var | Default | Clamped to | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_POLL_MS` | 2000 | 50–60000 | CaptureWriter poll interval. Lower for chatty apps, higher for quiet ones. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_LOG_BUFFER` | 500 | 50–10000 | In-memory log ring buffer size for `logs_tail` live mode. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DTD_URI` | — | — | Default DTD URI for `network_attach`. When unset, auto-discovery scans the standard `package:dtd` directory. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_DISCOVER_DTD` | `true` | `false` to disable | Set `false` to skip filesystem DTD auto-discovery at startup. Equivalent to `--no-auto-discover-dtd`. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DATA_DIR` | — | — | Directory for `captures.db`. Equivalent to `--data-dir`. When set, the candidate-fallback chain is skipped — unwritable values error loudly. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_MAX_ATTACH` | 4 | 1–32 | Max concurrent attached sessions in multi-attach mode. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH` | — | comma-list | **Allowlist** for auto-attach. Comma-separated substring patterns matched against the DTD app name. Non-empty value enables; empty / absent disables. Equivalent to `--auto-attach=app1,app2`. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH_DENY` | — | comma-list | **Denylist** for auto-attach (optional). Matching apps are skipped even when the allowlist would otherwise admit them. Equivalent to `--auto-attach-deny=pat1,pat2`. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH_POLL_MS` | 5000 | 1000–60000 | Poll interval for the auto-attach watcher. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_CAPABILITIES` | (all) | — | Allowlist (see below). |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DISABLE` | — | — | Denylist (see below). |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_NO_JIT_NUDGE` | — | `true` to silence | Suppresses the "running in JIT mode" stderr nudge that suggests `flutter_network_mcp install`. Set after you've decided you're fine with JIT startup. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_NO_UPDATE_CHECK` | — | `true` to silence | Skips the daily background version check entirely (no network access to GitHub raw on startup). |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_NO_TELEMETRY` | — | `true` to silence | Opts OUT of crash telemetry (0.7.1+) AND usage analytics (0.8.4+). With this set, the audit log is never written, no POST is attempted, and no tool-usage events are recorded. |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_NO_USAGE` | — | `true` to silence | Granular opt-out for tool-usage analytics only (0.8.4+), leaving crash telemetry on. See [Usage analytics](#usage-analytics-084). |
| `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_USAGE_GAP_MS` | 60000 | ≥1000 | Idle gap after which the usage correlation id rolls to a new "turn" (0.8.4+). |

## Telemetry (0.7.1+)

Crash telemetry is **on by default**, with one opt-out env var. In exchange, the MCP writes a **tamper-evident local audit log** of every byte it would send off-machine, hash-chained so any silent edit is detectable. Run `flutter_network_mcp audit verify` to walk the chain and prove nothing was sent without your knowledge.

### What gets sent

Only on uncaught errors (the runZonedGuarded handler catches them). One POST per crash. Payload:

```jsonc
{
  "version": "0.7.1",
  "commit": "4aa550c...",       // 12-char SHA, when known
  "isAot": true,
  "os": "macos 14.6",
  "dart": "3.5.0",
  "errorClass": "StateError",
  "errorMessage": "DTD is not connected.",
  "stackHead": [                // top 8 frames, paths redacted
    "#0 DtdClient._requireConnected (package:flutter_network_mcp/src/vm/dtd_client.dart:36)"
  ],
  "signature": "a3f7c8d219b4",    // sha256(errorClass + top-3-frames)[:12]
  "machineHash": "f1a823bc91...", // HMAC of your data-dir path
  "reportedAt": "2026-06-04T12:34:56Z"
}
```

### What's NOT sent

The path redactor strips everything user-identifying before recording. Never sent:

- `$HOME`, `cwd`, the target Flutter project path
- The target app's `vmServiceUri` / DTD URI / connection token
- Any captured HTTP body, header, URL
- Env-var contents
- `captures.db` row contents

### Audit log

Every report is recorded at `<data-dir>/telemetry-audit.log` — same payload, byte-for-byte, in a hash-chained append-only format. Inspect any time:

```bash
flutter_network_mcp audit verify              # walk the chain
flutter_network_mcp audit show                # decode + pretty-print
flutter_network_mcp audit show --since 7d     # last 7 days
flutter_network_mcp audit show --signature S  # specific crash group
```

Tamper-evident, not tamper-proof — you own the file. The chain catches any silent edit OR line removal, same model as `git log`.

### Opt out

```bash
export FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_NO_TELEMETRY=true
```

Set this and the telemetry code never runs. No audit write, no network attempt. Recommended for SOC 2 / regulated environments.

### Collector status

`kCollectorEndpoint` is currently empty (path B). 0.7.1 ships with audit-log-only mode — the binary writes the audit log so the trust pact's local half works, but the POST is stubbed pending maintainer-side Cloudflare deploy. When the URL is ready, a 0.7.1.x follow-up flips the constant and the same payload + opt-out + audit log all carry over.

## Usage analytics (0.8.4+)

Separate from crash telemetry: a **local, privacy-safe record of which tools agents call**, so the project can see how the MCP is actually used and build the right features. **Phase 1 is capture-only and local — nothing is shipped anywhere.**

Each tool call records: the tool name, a gap-based **correlation id** (groups a burst of calls into one "turn"), an **outcome** (`ok` / `error` / `empty`), the arg **KEYS** the agent passed (never their values), a duration, and a result size. That is the whole record — **no URLs, hosts, bodies, log text, or arg values** ever touch it, so it is PII-free by construction.

Inspect exactly what is stored at any time:

```bash
flutter_network_mcp usage                 # per-tool summary + outcome breakdown
flutter_network_mcp usage --show          # recent raw events
flutter_network_mcp usage --since 7d       # window filter
flutter_network_mcp usage --json           # machine-readable
```

On by default; opt out with `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_NO_USAGE=true` (usage only) or `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_NO_TELEMETRY=true` (everything).

**Phase 2 (0.8.5)** adds the `usage_stats` tool, so the aggregates are readable from inside an agent turn: per-tool counts, outcome rates (ok/error/empty), p50/p95 latency, and the tool→next-tool transition graph.

**Phase 3 (0.8.6)** ships those aggregates to the maintainer collector under the **same audit pact as crash telemetry**. A rollup (per-tool counts, outcome + latency stats, the transition graph; **never raw events or arg values**) is appended to the hash-chained `telemetry-audit.log` first, then POSTed to the collector when one is configured. Like crash telemetry it ships **audit-log-only** until the collector URL is baked in. It runs fire-and-forget on startup (daily-gated) and on demand:

```bash
flutter_network_mcp usage ship             # ship the rollup since the last watermark
flutter_network_mcp usage ship --dry-run   # build + print it, send nothing
flutter_network_mcp audit show --since 1h  # see the exact bytes that were recorded
```

A stored high-watermark (`usage-ship-state.json`) makes shipping idempotent, so re-running never double-counts.

## Capability gating (control your context budget)

Forty tools is a lot of schema for the agent to load. Disable the categories you don't use:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "flutter-network": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "flutter_network_mcp",
      "args": [
        "--dtd-uri", "ws://...",
        "--capabilities", "http,alerts,sessions,search"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

The opposite is `--disable sockets,sql,admin` — start from "all on" and remove. Lifecycle (`network_status`, `network_attach`, `network_detach`, `network_discover_dtd`, `report_issue`, `auto_attach_config`) is always on.

Categories: `http` · `sockets` · `logs` · `alerts` · `search` · `sessions` · `sql` · `admin`. Env vars: `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_CAPABILITIES`, `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DISABLE`.

When a category is disabled, the disabled tools don't appear in `tools/list` AND the corresponding capture paths don't run (no log subscription if `logs` is off; no alert detection if `alerts` is off). Real context AND CPU savings.

## What it does

### Live (while attached)

- **HTTP**: requests as they happen — method, URL, headers, status, both bodies. Filterable, cursor-based, body-truncated by default.
- **Sockets**: `dart:io` TCP/UDP byte counts.
- **Logs**: `Logging` + `Stdout` + `Stderr` streams.
- **Bodies truncate at 4 KB** by default. Truncated payloads return `totalSize` + `truncated:true` so the agent knows to call `network_body` for a byte range.

### Persistent (across sessions)

Every `network_attach` opens a SQLite capture session. A 2-second writer persists HTTP requests + headers + bodies + sockets + log records. When you reattach tomorrow:

- `session_list` shows what's there
- `session_open id:<n>` points every read tool at that session
- `session_export id:<n> format:har` writes a HAR 1.2 file (Chrome DevTools / Insomnia compatible)
- `network_query "SELECT ..."` for ad-hoc SQL

### Proactive (alerts pipeline)

The server runs detection rules on every captured request and log line:

| Rule | Fires on | Severity |
|---|---|---|
| `http_5xx` | HTTP status 500–599 | error |
| `http_4xx` | HTTP status 400–499 | warning |
| `http_error` | `dart:io` request/response errors | error |
| `http_slow` | duration > 3000ms (configurable) | warning |
| `log_keyword` | log matches `/error\|exception\|failed\|denied\|timeout\|refused\|crash/i` | warning (severe at level ≥1200) |
| `flutter_error` | log matches Flutter exception patterns (FlutterError, RenderFlex overflow, null check on null, setState after dispose, etc.) | critical |

The agent calls `alerts_drain` at the top of an investigation and gets the queue. `alerts_peek` reads without clearing. `alerts_config` tunes thresholds and toggles rules at runtime.

### Search (FTS5)

`network_search query="invalid_token"` returns ranked matches across URLs + utf8 request/response bodies with «highlighted» snippets. Queries are phrase-quoted by default so hyphens and special chars work naturally.

### Productivity polish

- **`network_diff idA idB`** — structural diff: status/method/url, response headers added/removed/changed, body hunks (line-based, for utf8 bodies).
- **`network_replay id`** — emits a runnable curl command. Authorization/Cookie/X-API-Key headers redacted by default; pass `redact:false` for local use.
- **`session_note id note`** — annotate sessions so future-you can find them ("auth bug 2026-05-21").
- **`ignored_hosts action:add host:...`** — drop analytics/Sentry/telemetry traffic at capture time so the DB only contains the requests that matter.

## Multi-attach (0.6.0)

You can attach to multiple running Flutter/Dart apps **simultaneously** — debug `eats_mobile` and `eats_driver` in the same agent conversation, in the same DB, without losing either side. Each attach gets its own VM connection, capture writer, and log buffer.

How it works in practice:

- `network_attach` for the first app → `sessionId:14` returned in the response's `scope` block.
- `network_attach` for the second app → `sessionId:15` (the first is untouched).
- `network_list` with no scope errors out: "ambiguous — 2 sessions attached" with `nextSteps` listing `sessionId:14  // eats_mobile`, `sessionId:15  // eats_driver`.
- `network_list sessionId:14` or `network_list appNameContains:"mobile"` returns just eats_mobile's rows.
- `network_detach all:true` drops everything cleanly when you're done.

Single-attach is unchanged — when only one session is attached, every tool auto-resolves to it and no extra args are needed. Multi-attach only adds friction when you genuinely have two apps in flight, and the friction is a structured error with a ready-to-paste fix.

Cap: `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_MAX_ATTACH` env var, default 4 (clamped 1–32). Each attach costs ~100 KB of memory (log buffer) + one 2s polling timer + 3 VM stream subscriptions.

### Multi-isolate within one app (0.6.0)

A single Flutter app can have multiple isolates (main + worker + spawned compute isolates). Previously the server captured HTTP from **only the first isolate** — worker traffic was silently invisible. **0.6.0 captures from every isolate** that exposes `ext.dart.io.getHttpProfile`, tags each captured row with its source isolate, and re-discovers newly-spawned isolates on a 10-tick (~20s) cadence so hot-reloads and runtime-spawned workers come into capture automatically.

Schema migration v3 → v4 adds nullable `isolate_id` columns. Pre-v4 rows keep `NULL` (treated as "VM-level" — still queryable, never excluded).

Every read tool that takes `sessionId:` also accepts an optional **`isolateId:`** to scope to one isolate within the session. Get the id from `network_status.attached[].isolates[].id`. Omit and the tool merges every isolate — same UX as single-isolate apps.

Per-row responses include `isolateId` when known so an agent can see which isolate produced each request, log, or socket.

### Cross-app correlate (0.6.0)

`network_correlate` is the typed companion to `network_query` SQL for the **webhook originator + receiver** pattern. When eats_mobile sends `POST /webhook/order` with body containing `txn-abc-123` and eats_driver receives `POST /handlers/order` a few hundred ms later with the same id, `network_correlate sessionIds:[14,15] pattern:"txn-abc-123" timeWindowMs:5000` returns both halves paired by time delta. See [`docs/tools/power/network_correlate.md`](docs/tools/power/network_correlate.md) for the full shape.

`sessionIds` is **required** — cross-session aggregation is intentional, so the agent must pick which apps to compare (preventing accidental cross-app data bleed). Hard caps: 8 sessions per call, 100 pair results, 500 raw matches per session.

### Auto-attach (`--auto-attach=app1,app2`)

Pass `--auto-attach=eats_mobile,eats_driver` (or set `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH=eats_mobile,eats_driver`) to have the server watch DTD for new apps and attach **only those matching the allowlist**.

There is **no boolean form**. Auto-attach without an explicit allowlist is intentionally not possible — it would risk silently grabbing whatever Flutter app the developer happens to spin up next (including one with production tokens). The value is a comma-separated list of substring patterns matched case-insensitively against the DTD app name.

The watcher polls every 5 seconds (`FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH_POLL_MS` to tune, clamped 1000–60000).

Key behaviour:
- **Allowlist is mandatory.** Apps whose name doesn't match any pattern log a one-line stderr note and are skipped. They're still added to the known-URI set so the watcher doesn't retry every tick.
- **Optional denylist** — pass `--auto-attach-deny="Pixel 7,Android emulator"` (or set `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_AUTO_ATTACH_DENY=Pixel 7,Android emulator`) to exclude specific devices even when they'd match the allowlist. Useful when the allowlist is a broad package name but you want to skip a particular device or form factor. Deny wins over allow.
- **Seed-and-skip on first tick** — apps already running when the server starts are NOT auto-attached even if they'd match the allowlist. The watcher seeds its "known" set with whatever DTD reports first, then only attaches to URIs that appear in subsequent ticks.
- **Manual `network_detach` is respected** — once you detach, the URI stays in the known set; the watcher won't re-grab it. Restart the app (new VM service URI) or detach + re-attach manually to bring it back.
- **Reentrancy-guarded** — only one tick runs at a time; concurrent timer fires are no-ops.
- **`FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_MAX_ATTACH` cap is respected** — over-cap discoveries log and skip without retry storm.
- **Crash-resistant** — every tick wraps a top-level try/catch; an unexpected throw doesn't kill the watcher.

DTD reports app names like `Flutter - iPhone 17 - Package: eats_mobile` — so substring patterns can target either the package (`eats_mobile`) or the device (`iPhone 17`, `Android emulator`, `iOS Simulator`). Example: `--auto-attach=eats_mobile --auto-attach-deny="Android emulator"` auto-attaches eats_mobile only on physical iOS + iOS Simulator.

## The 40 tools

Each tool's MCP `description` (loaded into every agent at handshake) tells the agent WHEN to reach for it. This table is the same information at a glance — useful when you want to remind an agent that a tool exists, or when picking the right one yourself.

**Scope:** ✅ = accepts optional `sessionId:int` and `appNameContains:string` for multi-attach disambiguation. When only one session is attached, both args are optional (auto-resolve). With 2+ attached and no scope hint, the tool errors with a structured `nextSteps` listing the attached sessions.

| Tool | Scope | Use when |
|---|---|---|
| **Lifecycle** | | |
| `network_status` | — | Always call first. Reports `attached:[]` list, DB path, active capabilities, known apps, pending alerts. Will auto-attach if exactly one app is reachable and nothing is attached yet. |
| `network_attach` | — | Connect to a running Flutter/Dart app to start capturing HTTP, sockets, and logs into a new session. **0.6.0:** can be called multiple times for different apps; per-vmServiceUri duplicate guard prevents accidental same-app re-attach. |
| `network_detach` | ✅ + `all:true` | End one capture session (sessionId / appNameContains), or `all:true` for every attached. DTD disconnects only when nothing remains attached. |
| `network_discover_dtd` | — | List DTDs on this machine from the standard `package:dtd` discovery dir. Auto-runs at startup when `--dtd-uri` is unset; call directly when multiple DTDs are running or to inspect stale candidates (`includeStale:true`). |
| `report_issue` | — | File a GitHub issue against this MCP from inside an agent turn (`type:"bug"` or `type:"ux"`). Uses `gh` CLI if available, else returns a paste-ready deep-link URL. Title + body path-redacted before submission (0.7.2). |
| `auto_attach_config` | — | Read + mutate the persistent auto-attach allowlist/denylist at `<data-dir>/auto-attach.json`. Lets the agent honor `autoAttachSuggestion` (from `network_attach`) without asking the user to edit shell rc. Always ask the user before calling (0.7.4). |
| `usage_stats` | — | Aggregate view of how agents use this MCP: per-tool counts, outcome rates (ok/error/empty), p50/p95 latency, and the tool→next-tool transition graph, from the local usage capture (0.8.5, #79 Phase 2). |
| `session_configure` | — | Set process-wide STICKY DEFAULT filters that `logs_tail` / `network_list` inherit when you omit the arg (set `levelMin` + `messageContains` / `statusMin` once instead of repeating them). An arg you pass still wins for that call. `clear:true` resets; no args views current (0.8.9, #18). |
| **HTTP** | | |
| `network_list` | ✅ | Browse recent HTTP requests by metadata: host, method, status, time. Cursor-paged. |
| `network_summarize` | ✅ | One digest row per endpoint over a time window: count, statusDist, p50/p95 latency, errorRate. Path templates collapse dynamic ids (`/api/users/N`). Cheaper than `network_list + manual bucketing` (0.7.0). |
| `network_get` | ✅ | Read full details of ONE request — headers + body + lifecycle events. Use after `network_list` or `network_search` finds the id. **0.7.0:** JSON/HTML bodies now semantic-truncate (arrays collapsed, scripts stripped) preserving structure. |
| `network_body` | ✅ | Fetch the rest of a truncated body. Call when `network_get` reports `truncated:true`. |
| `network_clear` | ✅ | Wipe the LIVE in-memory HTTP buffer for one session (DB untouched). |
| `network_diff` | ✅ | Compare two requests side-by-side to spot what changed — for regression hunting or confirming two are identical. |
| `network_replay` | ✅ | Emit a runnable curl command to reproduce a captured request in your terminal. Auth headers redacted by default. |
| **Sockets** | | |
| `socket_list` | ✅ | List `dart:io` socket connections (TCP/UDP). Mostly for correlating with HTTP. |
| `socket_get` | ✅ | Read one socket's read/write byte stats by id. |
| `socket_clear` | ✅ | Wipe the live socket buffer for one session (DB untouched). |
| **Logs** | | |
| `logs_tail` | ✅ | Read recent app logs: `print`, `developer.log`, stdout, stderr. Correlate with HTTP or chase an exception. **0.8.1:** `messageContains` greps the message body (works when loggers are unnamed). |
| `logs_clear` | ✅ | Wipe one session's live log ring buffer (DB untouched). |
| `correlate_at` | ✅ | Given an anchor `tsMs`, return logs AND HTTP requests within `+/-windowMs`, each tagged with signed `deltaMs`, nearest-first. Answers "which request fired closest to this log line?" (0.8.3). |
| **Alerts** | | |
| `alerts_drain` | ✅ | "What is wrong right now?" — returns pending alerts for the scoped session and marks them drained. Top of any investigation. |
| `alerts_peek` | ✅ | Same as drain but read-only (does NOT mark them drained). |
| `alerts_config` | — | Toggle alert rules / change thresholds at runtime (process-wide). |
| `alerts_clear` | ✅ | Bulk-delete alerts (drained-only by default; per-session scope). |
| `alert_patterns` | — | Add / list / remove custom regex alert rules (process-wide). |
| **Search** | | |
| `network_search` | ✅ | Find a request by text in URL or body (FTS5 ranked + highlighted). Use when you know WHAT was in the request but not the id. |
| `network_correlate` | sessionIds + pattern (both required) | Find matching requests **across 2+ sessions** by a shared substring (correlation id, webhook URL). Returns pairs sorted by smallest time delta. Caps: 8 sessions, 100 pairs, 500 matches/session. |
| **Sessions** | | |
| `session_list` | — | See past capture sessions. Pick one to reopen tomorrow. |
| `session_open` | — | Switch read tools to view a historical session (single-pointer history view). |
| `session_close` | — | Switch read tools back to the live session. |
| `session_export` | — | Write a session to a HAR 1.2 file (or NDJSON) for sharing. |
| `session_note` | — | Annotate a session ("auth bug 2026-05-21") so future-you can find it. |
| `session_delete` | — | Delete a session + every row attached to it (cascade). Requires confirm:true. |
| **SQL** | | |
| `network_query` | — | Run custom SELECT against the DB when the typed tools can't express what you need — aggregates, joins, percentile timings, cross-session queries. |
| **Admin** | | |
| `ignored_hosts` | — | Manage the capture-time host denylist (drop analytics / Sentry / telemetry). |
| `redacted_headers` | — | Manage the header denylist for `network_replay` curl emission. |
| `db_stats` | — | Report DB size, per-table row counts, body bytes. Tells you when to vacuum. |
| `db_vacuum` | — | WAL-checkpoint + VACUUM + optimize. Run after big deletes. |
| `bodies_purge` | — | Drop request/response BLOBs (keep metadata). Reclaim disk without losing history. |

**Per-tool docs live in [`docs/tools/`](docs/tools/) — every tool has its own page with a `## DO NOT USE THIS TOOL WHEN` section at the top.** Point your agent at these when you need deeper guidance than the one-liner above. The negative cases catch the bulk of misuse before it happens.

### The agent-facing contract

Every tool response — success OR error — follows the same shape, so an agent can branch on it without parsing prose:

- **`summary`** — one human-readable sentence (echo-able to the user).
- **`nextSteps`** — 1–3 concrete commands the agent can execute next; filtered against active capabilities.
- **`warnings`** — only present when something is partially degraded (truncation, in-flight, host not yet backfilled, etc.).
- **`pendingAlerts`** — `{count, critical?}` auto-injected on any success response when alerts are queued in scope. Lets the agent notice fresh alerts during normal work without polling `network_status` (the alerts pipeline is push-like in practice).
- **Errors** are `{error, contextual fields, nextSteps}` — never bare strings, never stack traces.
- Destructive ops (`session_delete`, `bodies_purge`, `alerts_clear` with `drainedOnly:false`) require explicit `confirm:true` / `force:true`; the default is a dry-run that reports impact.

## A typical session

```
You:    network_status
Agent:  capabilities:[http,alerts,sessions,search], attached:false, alerts:{pending:0}

You:    network_attach
Agent:  liveSessionId: 14

# poke around the app, server captures + alerts in the background

You:    alerts_drain
Agent:  3 alerts — 1 critical (Null check on null at home_screen:42), 2 errors (503 on /v1/login)

You:    network_search query:"invalid_token"
Agent:  req-1 — POST /v1/login — 500 — snippet "«invalid_token»"

You:    network_get id:req-1
Agent:  headers + 4 KB of body, truncated:true totalSize:18432

You:    network_body id:req-1 which:response offset:4096 length:16384
Agent:  bytes 4096-18432

You:    network_detach
You:    session_note id:14 note:"auth-bug repro for #1842"

# tomorrow
You:    session_list
Agent:  session 14 — auth-bug repro for #1842 — 38 req, 12 logs, 3 alerts

You:    session_open id:14
You:    network_query "SELECT host, AVG(duration_us)/1000 ms FROM http_requests WHERE session_id=14 GROUP BY host"
You:    session_export id:14 format:har outPath:/tmp/auth-bug.har
```

## The database

Lives at one `captures.db` file resolved via a fallback chain:

| Platform | Default path |
|---|---|
| macOS | `~/Library/Application Support/flutter_network_mcp/captures.db` |
| Linux / other | `${XDG_DATA_HOME:-~/.local/share}/flutter_network_mcp/captures.db` |

Override with `--data-dir` or `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DATA_DIR`. When neither is set, the server walks a candidate list (`$XDG_DATA_HOME` → platform default → `~/.cache`) and uses the first writable one, emitting a one-line stderr note if it fell back. Schema lives in [`docs/tools/network_query.md`](docs/tools/network_query.md).

> **macOS users upgrading from ≤0.5.15**: on first launch of 0.5.16, the server moves `~/.local/share/flutter_network_mcp/` to `~/Library/Application Support/flutter_network_mcp/` (atomic rename, WAL files included). Skipped if either dir's `captures.db` is missing or the new dir already has one. To opt out: set `--data-dir` or `FLUTTER_NETWORK_MCP_DATA_DIR` before launching.

WAL mode. Foreign keys with cascade delete. FTS5 virtual table for `network_search`. Indexes on `(session_id, start_us)`, `host`, `status_code`, `(session_id, timestamp_ms)`, `level`, `(drained, severity, ts_ms)`.

**Segmentation**: every captured row (`http_requests`, `http_bodies`, `socket_events`, `log_records`, `alerts`) has a `session_id` FK with `ON DELETE CASCADE`. One row in `sessions` per `network_attach` call — with `app_name`, `vm_service_uri`, `isolate_id`, `project_path`, `note`. Read tools always scope to the current live or opened session; cross-session queries go through `network_query`.

## Known issues

- **Zombie DTD** — A DTD can outlive useful service: WS upgrades succeed but RPCs hang forever. `network_attach` now fails fast within 5 seconds when this happens with a clear error. Restart the Flutter app to spawn a fresh DTD.
- **Body backfill lag** — Bodies are fetched on the writer's 2-second tick after a request completes. Live mode shows them immediately; history mode may be a beat behind. Also affects `network_search`, since FTS indexing happens during backfill.
- **Single-instance writer** — WAL mode means multiple MCP server instances against one DB *should* work, but it's untested. One MCP server per machine is the assumption.

## Local development

```bash
git clone <repo>
cd flutter_network_mcp
dart pub get
dart analyze
dart run tool/probe.dart 'ws://127.0.0.1:<port>/<token>='     # smoke-test DTD connectivity
dart run tool/seed.dart /tmp/test-captures                    # seed synthetic data
dart run bin/flutter_network_mcp.dart --dtd-uri 'ws://...' --data-dir /tmp/captures
```

Built with `package:dart_mcp`, `package:dtd`, `package:vm_service`, and `package:sqlite3`.
